# Fails when a callee proto pin in proto-refs.env isn't reachable from its
# owner's main, asking GitHub's compare API rather than a local clone. A pin
# off main (a squash-merged PR head, say) still resolves on codeload until
# GitHub drops the commit, so scripts/proto-generate.sh keeps working until it
# suddenly doesn't. The proto-sync workflow runs it from the root of the
# calling repo, before proto-sync.sh check.
#
# For each STEWARD_<NAME>_REF=<commit> line it calls
#   repos/<org>/steward-<name>/compare/<commit>...main
# and passes only when the status is "ahead" (main has moved on from the pin)
# or "identical". "behind" or "diverged" fails, and so does a 404 (no such
# repo, or no such commit in it).
#
# Needs gh on PATH, signed in or with GH_TOKEN set.
#
# Environment:
#   PROTO_SYNC_ORG  owner of the callee repos (default Steward-GRC)
